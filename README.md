# Dungeons and Dragons in C++
Dungeons and Dragons but in C++


This project was made in May 7th 2019, but I never had a github account until now 




    In this assignment I made a simplified version of dungeons and dragons 
      Lots of derived classes were used to make this assingment and they were derived off
      of the same class. Virtual functions were also used to help this lab since the pointers
     could access them since they are abstract classes.
